# Tasks
As mentioned above this project will be developed in stages or tasks. This project is divided into 5 tasks.
These tasks are defined as under -

1. Create basic web application with git as version control.
2. Create build scripts to deploy project, and to perform testing.
3. Research algorithms to effectively parse the build scripts and draw schema.
4. Implement the algorithm in the web application.
5. Implement profile creation for users.
